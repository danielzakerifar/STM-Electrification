# STM-Electrification
Transit Electrification Simulation Software
This project concerns the development of simulation software to serve as a decision support tool for
designing transit electrification projects.
Société de transport de Montréal (STM) would like to plan the electrification of the bus route 211 in their
transit network. To optimize the capital expenditure on building the charging facility and purchasing
electric buses, they need to make informed decisions on the configurations and numbers of both
chargers and buses. For chargers, they need to decide the types of chargers to be used, how many of
each types, and where to install them. For buses, they need to decide the battery size of the buses and
the fleet size to run the current operating schedule.
